# üìù Exercise8 - Iterative Prompting (Refinement) ~ 10 minutes
Iterative prompting involves refining your prompt (and the model‚Äôs response) in multiple steps. This approach is useful when you get partial or incomplete results and want to systematically improve them.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 1: Improve a Simple Data-Transformation Function Step by Step
Initial Prompt Example:
```typescript
// "Create a simple function that converts an array of numbers [1,2,3] into their squares [1,4,9]."
```

Refinement:
```typescript
// "Now modify the function to handle both positive and negative numbers and return absolute squares."
```

Further Refinement:
```typescript
// "Add type checks to ensure the function only accepts number arrays, otherwise return an error message."
```

Your turn
Step 1 Prompt:

```typescript
Write your initial prompt here
```

Model‚Äôs Response:

```

Step 2 (Refinement) Prompt:

```typescript
Write your refinement prompt here
```
Model‚Äôs Response:

```typescript
