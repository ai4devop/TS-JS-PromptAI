## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Analysis of Provided Examples

***Simple Meta-Prompt:***
The first exercise asks the model to generate an effective prompt for a to-do list of Angular 18 best practices. The solution suggests a well-structured prompt, covering essential aspects like component structure and service management.

***Combined Meta-Prompt:***
The second exercise uses the "act like" and "chain of thought" methods to generate a complex prompt, where the model must think step-by-step and act as an expert. The response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to combining the two techniques, providing detailed results.
